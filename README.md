Job board website
Create a job board website with Django. The main functionalities that need to be implemented are:

- User authentication and authorization
- Display a list of job postings with their details
- Allow job seekers to apply to job postings by submitting their resumes and cover letters
- Allow employers to post job openings and manage their listings
- Allow administrators to manage job postings, users, and applications
